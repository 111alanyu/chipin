# ChipIn

ChipIn is a web application to connect organizations with volunteers for local events.
It provides a space for organizations to interface directly with volunteers, promote
their events, and manage their volunteer list. ChipIn encourages peer-to-peer
interaction through social volunteering groups, connecting volunteers to other
volunteers through events and allowing users to join existing groups (e.g. schools, clubs).
